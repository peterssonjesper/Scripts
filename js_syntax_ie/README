Searches a single file, or a whole directory recursively, to identify possible errors that causes Internet Explorer to not run the javascript correctly.

Usage: python js_syntax_ie.py file.js
       python js_syntax_ie.py directory_to_scan

Example of error that would be found:

In IE this would not work (notice the comma):
{
	"my_key" : "my_value",
}
